# Data-Visualization-Of-Different-Industries
I made Data Visualization of the stable revenue in 2018 - 2019 in different industries here in the Philippines, show average stock price (current and previous) per industry and the connection between the average current stock price and 2019 revenue in the combination chart.

This is an extension of the industry analysis. Using the same list of companies data set (Dataset 3 - pivot) and (Dataset 4 - Stockprice).
I created two pivot tables: one showing the average current stock price of each industy grouped according to region, and another one showing the comparison of average previous stock price and average current stock price.
I used VLOOKUP to find the current and previou stock price, use FIND and LEFT to clean the current stock price. Convert the current stock price to number format.
I showed the visual representation to further analyze the data thru Data Visualization:
1) Which industry has a stable revenue in 2018-2019 (no drastic change)?
2) Show the average stock price (current and previous) per industry.
3) Draw a connection between the average current stock price and 2019 revenue? Illustrate in a combination chart.
